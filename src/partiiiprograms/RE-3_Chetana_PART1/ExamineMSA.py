ExamineMSA.py
--------------------
Examines the output files from FastaParser.py - output_fasta_file_mtDNA.fasta output_fasta_file_Y.fasta 
and performs MSA on each individually and produces 2 text files:
  1. One for mtDNA sequences
  2. One for Y chromosome sequences

Description:
    The result fasta files from previous code is used as inputs here, with a weight
    file. The fasta files are read and the sequences are read in aligned form. Pairwise 
    score is generated for all possibilities of nucleotides and multiple sequence
    alignment is performed on each fasta file sequences separately. The output files 
    are written the the given format.
    
Procedure:
    Functions created:
        To read Fasta file into dictionary
        To read a weight matrix
        To calculate identity and alignment score for a pair of sequences
        To write results in a text file
        The main function to perform quality checks and print output statement

Usage:
    python3 ExamineMSA.py output_fasta_file_mtDNA.fasta output_fasta_file_Y.fasta weight_parameters output_MSA_file

Outputs Example:
    output_MSA_file_mtDNA_scores.txt
    output_MSA_file_Y_scores.txt
